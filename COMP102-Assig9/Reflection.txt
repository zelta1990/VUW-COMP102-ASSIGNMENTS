1. Some of the methods in the ImageProcessor program could be done in two
different ways: "in-place" (only using the array containing the image), or
using a temporary array to store the image as it was being processed. Discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches. 
Advantage of in-place:save storage
disadvantage of in-place:time-consuming
advantage of using temporary array:Time-saving.Easy reference.
disadvantage of using temporary array:need more storage

this week, along with one sentence descriptions of them.
