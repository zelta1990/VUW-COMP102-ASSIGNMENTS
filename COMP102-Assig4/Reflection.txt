Questions for reflection:
=========================

1. Though the syntactic structure of a while statement is simple,
   getting the details right can be tricky. 

   * Which loops did you have difficulty getting right? while loop
   * Explain where the difficulty was.
Sometimes I’m not sure to define a variable outside the while loop or inside it.
2. Give several good test cases for the StockAnalyser program that
   would help you ensure that your program works correctly 
   I include 390 each time in the input to test whether the graph of it is drawn correctly.
3. Games that are too easy or too hard aren't fun to play.
   * What is an appropriate number of guesses to allow the user in the
     guessing game, and why? 
I think it should be no more than 10 times. Because 1 to 40 is not a huge range.

4. What are the additional concepts about programming and about Java
   that you have learned this week? 
   * Copy the concepts you listed in last week's Reflection, fixing up
     any of the descriptions if you have a better understanding of
     them now 
     While loop and if loop.These two loops can do many repetitive jobs and save lines.
   * Add the new concepts you have acquired this week, along with one
     sentence descriptions of them. 
     nextInt(),nextLine().These methods wait for the user’s input.
