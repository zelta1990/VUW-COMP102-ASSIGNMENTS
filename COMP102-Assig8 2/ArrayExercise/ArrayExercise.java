     * Simple duck shooting game
     *  Uses the Duck class, which has a constructor and two methods:
     *   - To construct a duck, specify its horizontal position: eg new Duck(100);
     *   - jiggle() makes the duck jump up and down a few times
     *   - shoot() turns it upside down. You can't jiggle a duck after you have shot it.
     * 
     * The duckGame method should
     * - Construct an array to hold 5 Ducks,
     * - Fill the array with Ducks placed across the screen (at 200, 300, 400, 500, 600)
     *       The Duck constructor has one parameter - the position of the duck.
     *       the position of the i'th duck should be 200+(i*100)
     * - Have a loop that repeats 5 times:
     *   - Ask the user for the number of a duck to shoot ( 0 to 4)
     *   - IF the answer is valid and that element of the array contains a duck, THEN
     *      shoot the duck (call the shoot method on the duck), 
     *      remove it from the array (put null in the array element)
     *     ELSE
     *      tell the user they missed
     *   - jiggle all the remaining ducks (each array element that isn't null)
