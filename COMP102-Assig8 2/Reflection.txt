Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. Explain why "off-by-one" errors are so easy to make when programming with
arrays.
Because it’s easy to forget that an array counts from 0 instead of 1.

2. Both CardGame and Genealogy used another class that was written for you.
This saved you writing some code, but also constrained you to write the program in a particular way. 
Discuss advantages and disadvantages you found when having a predefined class that you had to use as part of your program.
The advantage is that you can call the methods of predefined class in current class conveniently.The disadvantage is that you can’t make changes to that predefined class.

3. Add to your programming "concept map" the additional concepts about programming and about Java that you
have learned this week. (As usual, copy your answer from last assignment, fixing up any of the descriptions
if you have a better understanding of them now, and add the new concepts you have acquired this week, along
with one sentence descriptions of them.
Last week’s concept:
Array:an object with a sequence of places to store the same type of values.
ArrayLists: lists of values that can grow and shrink; a class in the standard libraries.

This week’s concept:
wrapper class：A class to wrap up numbers into objects.
