1. Explain why  arrays are better than using lots of variables when your program needs to store lots of values.
Array saves lines.When using array,command can act on the whole array.

2. Arrays allow you to write programs with collections of data, but so do files. What are the similarities and differences between files and arrays.  What can you do with one that is hard or impossible with the other?
Both array and file can be used to store a lot of values but file can only read or write one value at a time.One can easily get and use a value in an array. A file can store different types of data while an array can’t.

3. Add to your programming "concept map" the additional concepts about programming and about Java that you have learned this week. (As usual, copy your answer from last assignment, fixing up any of the descriptions if you have a better understanding of them now, and add the new concepts you have acquired this week, along with one sentence descriptions of them. 
Last week’s concept:
Fields:filed are where the object to store information involved with the object.
This week’s concept:
Array:an object with a sequence of places to store the same type of values.
ArrayLists: lists of values that can grow and shrink; a class in the standard libraries.
