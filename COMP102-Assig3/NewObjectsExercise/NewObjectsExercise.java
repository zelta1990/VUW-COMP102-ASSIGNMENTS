/** The NewObjectsExercise class has several simple methods
that involve creating new objects and calling methods on those objects.
- flowers() should create two or three Flower objects and
make them grow and bloom
- balloons() should create two Balloon objects and
make them expand and pop
- bankAccounts() should create two BankAccount objects and
deposit to, withdraw from, and print statements of them
- cars() should create two Car objects and make them
drive towards each other then turn to the side and drive some more
- studentMarks() should create two StudentMarkRecord objects and record
several marks for each student and display their current assignment status
