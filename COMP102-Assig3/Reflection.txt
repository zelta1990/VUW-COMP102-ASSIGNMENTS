Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

1. In the BusinessReminders program, how did you go about deciding what
parameters the new method should have?  Can you suggest a good procedure for
doing this?


2.  What are the additional concepts about programming and about Java that you
have learned this week?  
 - Copy the concepts you listed in last week's reflection, and fix the
   descriptions up if you have a better understanding of them now
 - Add the new concepts you have acquired this week, along with one sentence
   descriptions of them.
