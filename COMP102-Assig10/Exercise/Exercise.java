/** Exercise
    The program lets the user draw circles and move them around.
    The program has fields to store
     - an array of Circle objects
     - whether it is currently drawing new circles or moving them around
     - the index of the Circle the mouse was last pressed on.
    If the program is drawing new circles, then releasing the mouse
     on the graphics pane will create a new Circle at that point and add
     it to the collection.
    If the program is moving circles around, then if the mouse was pressed on
     top of a Circle, it will then be moved to the position the mouse is released.
