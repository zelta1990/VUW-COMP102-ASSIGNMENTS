/** A PartyBalloon object represents a small round balloon on the graphics pane.
    It remembers its current position and its color.
    Its initial position and its color are set when it is constructed
    The diameter of a balloon should be 30.
    It has three methods:
      draw(),      which draws the balloon at its current position
      riseLeft(),  which makes the balloon rise up by 20, and move 5 to the left
      riseRight(), which makes the balloon rise up by 20, and move 5 to the right
