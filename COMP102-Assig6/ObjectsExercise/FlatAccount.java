/** A FlatAccount keeps track of the balances of two kinds of expenses in a flat:
    rent and food.
    When a new Flat Account object is constructed, the balances are set to 0.
    The constructor should have one argument -
      the name of the flat, which should be stored in the object.

    FlatAccount has three methods:
     - printBalances(), which prints out a statement of the two balances.
     - expense(...), which makes a payment of some amount from the flat
       account out of one of the balances. (reduces the balance)
       Requires the name of the balance ("rent" or "food"), and the amount of payment.
     - contribute(...), which records a deposit of some amount into the flat account
       (puts the amount into the smallest balance)
       Requires the amount.
