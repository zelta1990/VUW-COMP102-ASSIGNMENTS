/** Lets the user draw "stars" - lots of lines from a center point.
 * After clicking the "Set Center" button, the user can set (or reset)
 *  the center of a new star using the mouse.
 *  (Note, nothing happens directly in response to the button -
 *   the program just remembers that the user is about to change the center point.)
 * After clicking the "Set Tips" button, the user can click anywhere to
 *  add a new tip to the star:
 *  the program will draw a line from the current center to the new point.
 *  (Note, nothing happens directly in response to the button - the program just
 *   remembers that the user is about to set the positions of tips of the star.)
 * Note that neither of the buttons will draw anything directly - they
 *  just record whether user is about to choose the center or a tip.
 * The user can click the "Clear" button to clear the graphics pane or
 *  click the "Set Color" button to change the color
 *  (using the JColorChooser.showDialog(...) method).
