/** The CirclesExercise program is a very simple program that lets the user place small 
    and large circles on the graphics pane using the mouse.
    It has three buttons: Small, Large, and Clear.
    The "Small" button should change the "current size" to 10, and the "Large" button
    should change the current size to 30. The current size should be stored in a field.
    The Clear button should clear the graphis pane.
    When the user releases the mouse at any point on the graphics pane, the program
    should draw a blue circle at that point.
