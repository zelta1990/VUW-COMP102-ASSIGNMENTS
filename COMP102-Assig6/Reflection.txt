Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. For the FrogGame program, you had to choose fields to store the states of the
frogs and the cars. There are several reasonable choices for this, not just the
suggested one. What other choices could you have made? What would the
consequences of your choice be when you came to write the methods - what would
be easier the suggested way, and what would be easier the other way? 

I could think of define their states as local variables and declare them in the method as many times as I want however the data can only be accessed within the method.
When data is only used in one method, it’s more efficient to declare variables accordingly.
When data is used through the class it’s better to store them in datafield.

2. For MiniPaint, you had to work out how to make event-driven input work. What
was difficult? Was it more difficult than the previous programs? If so, in what
way?
I found it difficult to make the Fill/noFill button work because it needs to provide two results in one mouse action.

3. Add to your programming "concept map" the additional concepts about
programming and about Java that you have learned this week. (As usual, copy
your answer from last assignment, fixing up any of the descriptions if you have a
better understanding of them now, and add the new concepts you have acquired
this week, along with one sentence descriptions of them. 
Last week’s concepts:1.try and catch.This method can be used to analyse what goes wrong when reading a file.
2.PrintStream class. Used for writing to a file.
This week’s new concept:
Fields:filed are where the object to store information involved with the object.
