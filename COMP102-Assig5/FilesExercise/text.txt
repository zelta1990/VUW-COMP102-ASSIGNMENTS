these are words you should not be typing out.  They
are all the words that appear in the file.
the program is supposed to print nothing but the
first word of each line, not all the 
words in the file. After reading the first word
on a line, your program should throw away the rest of the line.
each exercise is slightly different; this one reads by
line as well as by word. You should read the first word
of a line with the next() method and the rest of 
this line with the nextLine() method. You don't have to write to a
file in any of the exercises.
